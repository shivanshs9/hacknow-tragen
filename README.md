Global collaboration research platform for transparent genomics data sharing

Submission for [HACK: Now hackathon](https://hacknow.calhacks.io/) 

## Problem
> “Researchers believe that the data collected from across the  world: China, Australia, United States, Iran, Europe with public research-funds should be freely, immediately and readily accessible to all members of the global scientific community.” [ref](https://www.biostars.org/p/427840/)


_The primary concern of researchers is data privacy, data security and data provenance._

With Tragen, we aim to change power dynamics from the centralised, private institution to the open culture of researchers community via a distributed network. 

By providing a simple, user-friendly open platform, purpose-built for Genomic Sequence research collaboration that establishes the provenance of research outputs, and accelerates sharing, developing vaccines/medicines and citation recognition for contributions to the scholarly record. And put the rights over their own data in the hand of researchers.
